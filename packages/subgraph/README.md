## @my-app/subgraph

The Graph is a tool for for indexing events emitted on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides you with an easy-to-use GraphQL API.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### Subgraph

#### `yarn codegen`

Generates AssemblyScript types for smart contract ABIs and the subgraph schema.

#### `yarn build`

Compiles the subgraph to WebAssembly.

#### `yarn auth`

Before deploying your subgraph, you need to sign up on the
[Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/). There, you will be given an access token. Drop it in the command
below:

```sh
GRAPH_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token-here yarn subgraph:auth
```

#### `yarn deploy`

Deploys the subgraph to the official Graph Node.<br/>

Replace `paulrberg/create-eth-app` in the package.json script with your subgraph's name.
